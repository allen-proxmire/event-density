# Event Density (ED) Research Program  
### *A Unified Ontology of Becoming, Structure, Geometry, and Physical Law*  
**Allen Proxmire — 2025–2026**

---

## Overview

The Event Density (ED) program develops a unified ontological framework in which **becoming**—the continual production of micro-events—is the primitive structure of reality. From this single commitment, the familiar layers of physics emerge:

- spacetime  
- curvature  
- quantum behavior  
- information  
- thermodynamics  
- cosmology  
- physical law  

The ED program is presented as a sequence of **11 papers**, each building on the last. Together, they form a coherent architecture that reframes physics from the ground up.

All papers are archived with DOIs via Zenodo and mirrored on PhilPapers.

## 🧭 Purpose of the Program

The ED program aims to:

- provide a unified ontological foundation for physics  
- dissolve long-standing conceptual tensions (QM vs GR, information vs geometry, etc.)  
- show how classical, quantum, relativistic, and cosmological behavior arise from a single substrate  
- offer a clean, architectural alternative to substance-based metaphysics  
- demonstrate that physical law is emergent, not fundamental

## 🧩 Future Work

Upcoming papers include:

- **Paper 12: Agency in the Event Density Ontology**  
  *How self-maintaining ED structures become self-directed.*

- Additional mathematical extensions  
- Biological thresholds and autopoiesis in ED  
- Computational and informational interpretations
