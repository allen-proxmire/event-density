# Event Density and the Architecture of the Universe
### *How Spacetime, Gravity, Quantum Behavior, and the Arrow of Time Emerge from Event Density*

## Overview
This repository contains the manuscript and supporting materials for **Event Density and the Architecture of the Universe**. The project develops Event Density (ED) as the primitive structural quantity from which spacetime, gravity, quantum behavior, information, entropy, and temporal direction emerge. The aim is to present a clear, architectural account of how the universe organizes itself and why its large‑scale features are inevitable consequences of ED dynamics.

## Abstract
Event Density (ED) is introduced as the primitive structure from which spacetime, gravity, quantum behavior, information, and the arrow of time emerge. Instead of beginning with particles, fields, or geometry, the framework begins with the rate at which micro‑events occur and shows how ED gradients generate curvature, classicality, horizons, and cosmological evolution. The result is a unified, structural account of why the universe has the large‑scale features it does—without invoking new substances, hidden variables, or additional laws. ED offers a single architectural principle that makes the familiar structures of physics inevitable.
